# D3 Floorplan and Zoning

### Good D3 Examples
- [Zoom pan and axis rescale](http://bl.ocks.org/stepheneb/1182434)
- [Drag and Zoom with background check](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/6123708)
- [Explaining Dragging in D3](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15009718/explaining-mike-bostocks-d3-js-dragmove-function)
-[Draggin multiple nodes, bounded](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/1557377)
- [Using Force layout](http://jsfiddle.net/aVhd8/177/)


### Plan
1. Get the polygon JSON data visualized in d3
2. using polygon as bounds add nodes
3. connect nodes into a polygon
4. make function that saves polygon as new zone (also new bounding area, i.e. next node is contained by some zone)
